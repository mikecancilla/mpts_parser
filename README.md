MPEG Transport Stream to XML
----------------------------

A command line app that will parse an MPEG Transport Stream and generate an XML document which represents the stream.

Example command line.  This will write xml to output.xml, and it will print the progress.

    mpts_parser -e file.mpts > output.xml

The XML files generated by this program can be used as input to my mpts_analyzer program.

MPEG files in a transport stream can be found here: https://dveo.com/downloads/VGA2/sample-digital-signage-streams.html


BUILDING
--------

Supports Linux/MacOS/Windows.

- Launch a shell, on Windows launch the Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio
- Clone the mpts_parser repo at https://github.com/mikecancilla/mpts_parser.git
- Enter the mpts_parser directory, then:

% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake ..

You will now have a Makefile on Linux/MacOS, then run 'make' to build. On Windows you will have mpts_parser.sln.
